# Observer Pattern

This is an application utilizing the Observer pattern.

# Application Description
A consortium of shops in a large city has established an agreement with local independent van and
taxi drivers to deliver products from city shops to customer destinations.
In this assignment, you will implement a notification system to send notifications about delivery
requests to drivers. When a store gets a product delivery orders should be created at store and a
delivery request should be broadcasted to all drivers.


# Implementation Description
* How flexible is your implementation, e.g., how you add or remove in future new drink types?

    * For this assignment I have taken into account two more possible classes and added them into the design pattern with minimal implementation. The flexibility of my implementation is moderate. Future and further implementation can be made with the possibility to change or delete some existing code.

* How is the simplicity and understandability of your implementation?

    * The simplicity and understandability of my implementation are high.

    * There is no user interface or user interaction implemented for this program.
    
    * Every class and every method are properly and thoroughly commented.  
    
    * Utilized helper method(s) to help keep implementation clean.

* How you avoided duplicated code?

    * I have minimized hard coding and used for loops and shared methods for duplicated code.
